### TL;DR

Use git

--

Avoid this workflow:

1. Copy/paste files
--

2. Edit files

--
3. Save with new version number

--
4. Try to keep track of the mess!

--
5. Good luck with >2 collaborators!

### What is git?

---
### What is git?

- Distributed/decentralized version control
- Coordinate work among multiple developers (and data scientists/analysts!)
- Track file history (code and non-code)
- Snapshots, aka commits
- Can easily go back in time

---

### Short history of git <sup>1</sup>

- Developed in 2005 by Linus Torvald
- Evolved from the Linux kernel

### Principles: 

- Speed
- Simple design
- Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches)
- Fully distributed
- Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently

### _Distributed_ version control 

Users don't just checkout snapshots of a project

- Every clone is a full backup of entire project
  - including history of all changes. 
- Not reliant on any server. 
- Any user repository can be used to restore server in event of crash

---

## Git basics

#### Repositories (_repos_)

- Hidden folder `.git/` inside a project that tracks all changes to project files
- Any local directory can be turned into a git repo
- Remote repos can be _cloned_ into your computer

--

#### Snapshots (_commits_)

Git thinks about data as snapshots in time. 

If a file hasn't changed since a previous version, it's not redundantly stored. 


---

#### Integrity

- Everything is checksummed before storing
- Impossible to make changes or have file corruption without Git knowing about it

#### Git only adds

- Just about every action in Git adds data
- Easy to revert to any prior state, hard to lose work or screw up a project

---

### Three states of Git

At any time, any file resides in one of three states: 

1. `Modified`: you have changed the file but have not committed it to history yet
2. `Staged`: a modified file is marked in its current version to go into the next commit.
3. `Committed`: the file is registered to the project history

---

### Basic workflow:

1. **Modify** files in your project
2. **Stage** the changes you want to be part of your next commit
  - only those changes are added to the staging area.
3. **Commit**: take the files in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your history.

---

### Basic commands: local

- `$ git init`: initialize repo
- `$ git add <file>`: add files to staging area
- `$ git rm --cached <file>`: remove files from staging
- `$ git status`: get status of changes to files
- `$ git commit`: commit (aka make checkpoint)

--

There are GUIs available, but I recommend learning the basics on the command line!

# Branches

---

### Branches 

Sub-versions of a project that can split off from the main project and merge back together. 



- Useful for prototyping without messing up the main branch <sup>1</sup>
- Extremely fast to switch between branches

## Git vs GitHub/BitBucket

.pull-left[

```{r, echo=F, out.width="20%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git.png")
```
#### Git
- Version control software
- Stand alone, can be used on its own
]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo=F, out.width="20%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/octocat.png")
```
#### GitHub/BitBucket
- Git based service for hosting code
- Eases collaboration and development
- Provides additional features on top of plain git

# Basic commands: remotes

- `$ git clone`: make a copy of a remote repo
- `$ git push`: send committed work to remote repo
- `$ git pull`: pull other's work from remote repo

_Note:_ Need to set up authentication with remote

---

### A few best practices 

- Track all projects involving code with git

--

- Use clear and concise commit messages

--

- Commit early, commit often

--

- Use a `.gitignore` file
  - exclude files such as `.ipynb`, `.DS_STORE`, `RHistory` from being commited to project history
  - Depending on project, may want to exclude data files
  
--

- Do all prototyping on branch
  - Submit pull requests to merge back into main
  - Assign reviewer(s) to PRs
  - Stress test code before approving

--

- Repo name should match local folder name
  - important for reproducibility

---

### Repeated Amend

Natural to be 'commit-shy': don't want to clutter a repository

--

- Make a few changes, then add and commit with a work in progress message (but don't push):

```
git commit -m "WIP"
```
--

- Make more changes, commit again, but _amend_ the previous commit: 

``` 
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

--

- Repeat above while working on that bit of code
  - If you mess up, you can go back to the latest WIP commit

--

-  When finished, give a proper commit message and push:

```
git commit --amend -m "New awesome feature done!"
git push
```

# Workflows

---

## Clone

1. Clone a remote repository
2. Make changes locally (on appropriate branch!)
3. Commit and push to remote

--

#### Pros:

- Simple

#### Cons:

- Gets messy with several collaborators

## Fork and Clone

.pull-right[
- _Fork_: your own remote copy (in GitHub, BitBucket)
- Clone that fork to local, and work from there
- Best not to commit to main branch

## Fork and Clone

.pull-right[
- Set upstream to the source repo
- Pull from upstream
- Push to your forked remote
- Submit PR to pull changes on your fork into source repo
